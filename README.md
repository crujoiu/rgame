# rgame

Modernized endless runner game built with TypeScript and Vite.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` starts the local dev server.
- `npm run build` runs TypeScript checks, creates a production build, and precompresses assets as `.gz` and `.br`.
- `npm run preview` serves the production build locally.
- `npm run typecheck` runs TypeScript checks only.
